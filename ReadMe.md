ConnectED is the platform where the govt schools can connect with other schools to enhance their knowledge and best practices in teaching. Also, can seek/provide support from/to other schools. School profile can also raise help requests which can be accepted by volunteers in the system. Schools can also raise feedbacks to higher executives. This platform enhances the teaching capabilities with the help of other schools in the network and get support from volunteers.

The platform provides an ability to school to connect to right profile at right time in fulfilling their needs.
